# CAS AML Final project

Machine and Deep Learning Solutions to Differentiate Epithelial Tissues via ATR FTIR Spectroscopy

1) Project Description

This project focuses on the classification of tissue types using Attenuated Total Reflectance Fourier-Transform Infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy data combined with machine learning techniques. The primary goal is to accurately distinguish between olfactory epithelium (OE), respiratory epithelium (RE), and tracheal tissues. The secondary goal is to characterize these tissue by model analysis.
